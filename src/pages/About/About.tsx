      <p>
        Iâ€™m an ambitious, 27 year-old {'<'}/salt{'>'} graduate with a passion
        for programming currently living in Stockholm. Learning new technologies
        and concepts and helping others develop is something I really enjoy, as
        well making tools and building amazing software that makes life easier
        for others. I used to work as a personal technician but now want to get
        involved more with software as it is my true passion.
