      graduate with a passion
      for programming currently living in Stockholm. Learning new technologies
      and concepts and helping others develop is something I really enjoy, as
      well making tools and building amazing software that makes life easier
      for others. I used to work as a personal technician but now want to get
      involved more with software as it is my true passion.
